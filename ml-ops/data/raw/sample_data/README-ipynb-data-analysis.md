Create a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis of telecommunications network data with the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Overview
   - Import necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
   - Load the dataset from our DVC-tracked source
   - Display basic information (shape, columns, data types)
   - Show summary statistics

2. Data Quality Assessment
   - Check for missing values
   - Identify duplicates
   - Examine outliers
   - Validate data ranges for key metrics

3. Feature Distribution Analysis
   - Create histograms for numerical features
   - Plot categorical feature distributions
   - Analyze target variable distribution
   - Identify skewed features

4. Correlation Analysis
   - Create correlation matrix
   - Plot heatmap
   - Identify top correlated features
   - Examine multicollinearity

5. Time-based Analysis (for network performance data)
   - Plot time series of key metrics
   - Identify trends and patterns
   - Look for seasonality or cyclical patterns

6. Feature Engineering Ideas
   - List potential derived features
   - Document transformation ideas

7. Initial Insights and Next Steps
   - Summarize key findings
   - Note issues requiring further investigation
   - Outline preprocessing steps for modeling
